# Todo Prototype

Our designer is great! They've created our todo app in HTML and CSS, wrapped with Create React App.

Now we just need to turn it into a working app.

**UI Features**

1. Update list from hardcode todos to todos kept in react state
2. Ability to show and change if a todo is completed or not
3. Ability to delete a todo
4. Show count of how many todos are left
5. Ability to create a new todo
6. A filter to show All / Active / Completed todos
7. Optimize the todos to minimize render passes
8. Get todos from the REST endpoint `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`
9. Add a date & time picker (from an external UI lib) and include a datetime for each todo

**Data Features**

1. Add the Graph component - and update it to use real numbers (supplied in component)
